@theme @theme_snap @theme_snap_course
Feature: When the moodle theme is set to Snap, teachers can move course sections without using drag and drop and without
  having to enter edit mode.

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | format | initsections |
      | Course 1 |     C1    |     0    | topics |      1       |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email |
      | teacher1 | Teacher | 1 | teacher1@example.com |
      | student1 | Student | 1 | student1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user | course | role |
      | teacher1 | C1 | editingteacher |
      | student1 | C1 | student |
    And the following "activities" exist:
      | activity | course               | idnumber | name             | intro                         | section |
      | assign   | C1                   | assign1  | Test assignment1 | Test assignment description 1 | 1       |
      | assign   | C1                   | assign2  | Test assignment2 | Test assignment description 2 | 1       |

  @javascript
  Scenario Outline: In read mode, teacher moves section 1 before section 4 (section 3).
    Given I log in as "admin"
    And the following config values are set as admin:
      | coursepartialrender | <Option> | theme_snap |
    And I log out
    And I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    And I follow "Section 1"
    And I follow "Untitled Section"
    And I set the section name to "My & < > Section"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I follow "My & < > Section"
    And I follow "Move \"My & < > Section\""
    Then I should see "Moving \"My & < > Section\"" in the "#snap-footer-alert" "css_element"
    When I follow "Section 4"
    And I follow "Place section \"My & < > Section\" before section \"Section 4\""
    Then I should see "My & < > Section" in the "#section-3 .sectionname" "css_element"
    And "#chapters h3:nth-of-type(4) li.snap-visible-section" "css_element" should exist
    # Check that navigation is also updated.
    # Note that "4th" refers to section-3 as section-0 is the "introduction" section in the TOC.
    When I click on the "4th" link in the TOC
    Then I should see "My & < > Section" in the "#section-3 .sectionname" "css_element"
    Then the previous navigation for section "3" is for "Section 3" linking to "#section-2"
    And the next navigation for section "3" is for "Section 4" linking to "#section-4"
    And I follow "Section 4"
    And the previous navigation for section "4" is for "My & < > Section" linking to "#section-3"
    When I follow "Section 2"
    And the next navigation for section "1" is for "Section 3" linking to "#section-2"
    # The data-section attribute of the moved section module link should match the section number.
    # This is done so activities are created in the correct section.
    When I follow "My & < > Section"
    And "//button[contains(text(),'Create learning activity') and @data-sectionid=3]" "xpath" should be visible
    Examples:
      | Option     |
      | 0          |
      | 1          |
