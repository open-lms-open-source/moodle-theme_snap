Feature: Animated images should be accessible.

  Background:
    And I skip because "This test fails randomly in Gitlab when hovering the elements."
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | format | maxbytes | enablecompletion | initsections |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | topics | 500000   | 1                |       1      |
    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname | lastname | email                |
      | teacher1 | Teacher   | 1        | teacher1@example.com |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user     | course | role           |
      | teacher1 | C1     | editingteacher |

  @javascript
  Scenario: Animated images can be paused, and their animation can be resumed afterwards.
    Given I log in as "teacher1"
    And I am on the course main page for "C1"
    And I upload file "testgif_small.gif" to section 1
    And I follow "Section 1"
    And I hover ".snap-animated-image img" "css_element"
    Then I click on ".anim-pause-button" "css_element"
    And "img[src$='.gif']" "css_element" should not be visible
    And I hover ".snap-animated-image" "css_element"
    And I click on ".anim-play-button" "css_element"
    And "img[src$='.gif']" "css_element" should be visible
